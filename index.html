                    <h2>Early life</h2> <br>
                    <p>Kempe Gowda was born in the Yelahanka suburb of Bangalore in the Morasu Vokkaliga community to Kempananje Gowda, the ruler of Yelhanka for more than 70 years.The Morasu Vokkaligas were Vijayanagara vassals at Yelahanka.

                        Sources vary on the ancestry of Kempe Gowda. Burton Stein and others note that Morasu Vokkaligas were Telugu migrants to the Morasu-nadu area in the fourteenth century.Some state that they were originally from Karnataka and were a Kannada-speaking community,although well-versed in Telugu. Some sources mention that they were a Tamil-speaking community from Kanchi which moved to present-day Karnataka in the early 15th century to serve in Vijayanagara armies.
                        
                        Kempe Gowda, who is reputed to have shown leadership skills during his childhood,was educated for nine years at a gurukula in Aivarukandapura (or Aigondapura), a village near Hesaraghatta.</p>
